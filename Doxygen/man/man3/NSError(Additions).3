.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Helper category class that is used in conjuction with the NSDictionary+Additions category throughout the app whenever we want to inform the user that no internet activity is present; may be an overkill as a category, but as more custom errors are needed by the app, these categories should make it much easier to maintain them all
