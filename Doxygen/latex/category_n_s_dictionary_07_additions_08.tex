\subsection{Detailed Description}
Helper category class that is used in conjuction with the N\+S\+Error+\+Additions category throughout the app whenever we want to inform the user that no internet activity is present; may be an overkill as a category, but as more custom errors are needed by the app, this category should make it much easier to maintain them all
